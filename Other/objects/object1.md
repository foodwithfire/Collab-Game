### Description

**Lemonwater** is a **Common** Item that may be found everywhere in the world.

As its name tells, **Lemonwater** is pure uncorrupted water with a taste of lemon juice; however, it's not
acid, but more sweet. It has been proven that Lemonwater contains water, lemon juice, citric acid (from the
lemon), sugar as well as an ingredient never seen before, that adds a little almond/vanilla flavour, designated
as *Lemonalmond*. Its properties aren't fully discovered yet; however, it's known that **Lemonwater** grants
extra energy, and it was supposed that Lemonalmond was a derivative of caffeine never discovered before. This
theory hasn't been proven yet.

Tin cans containing **Lemonwater** are roughly 6 inches tall (12,5cm) and full of **Lemonwater**. Each can contains
250 mL. Consumption of already opened cans is highly discounselled because of the potential bacteria and viruses the
Wanderer (or Monsters) that drank in it had. Scientist estim that you have 1 chance on 4 to get an infection by
drinking already opened cans. If you're in doubt, boil the water, that will likely kill any bacteria or virus in the
water.


**Lemonwater** is, currently, the only known efficient way of hydratation in the world, because
of the toxicity of corrupted water. However, **Lemonwater** has taste that may block some people from
drinking it.

**Lemonwater** is then the best drink in the world, since the water was corrupted by monsters.

### Location & Appearance

**Lemonwater** can be found almost everywhere in the world, except in monsters inhabited areas and desolate lands.
**Lemonwater** may appear in plastic bottles, but they appear more frequently in tin cans. Some glass bottles, very
rarely, also have been reported.

**Lemonwater** appears generally during the night, mostly in villages, fields and human inhabited places, such
as a tent in the wilderness. The way **Lemonwater** appears is still unknown, but eyewitnesses declare they just
appear, and that before there wasn't anything.

**Lemonwater** was first found during the First Monstrous War, but people thought it was poison delivered by
monsters and then didn't drink it. At the end of the war, **Lemonwater** has immediately stopped appearing in the
world. It seems that **Lemonwater** only appears when water is corrupted during Monstrous Wars.

### Dangers

**Lemonwater** can become toxic if drank at high rates. It can occur diabetes, as well as "bewildement of awareness", which will
make the drinker really confused, puzzled for simple things. This state generally lasts 8 hours. It is then not recommanded to
drink more than 3 cans of **Lemonwater** per day (750 mL/day).
